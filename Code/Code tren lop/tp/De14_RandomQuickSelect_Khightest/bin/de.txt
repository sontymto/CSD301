Create a program that require the user to 
input an array of n rhombuses (h√¨nh thoi). 
Each rhombus has a two diagonals d1 (double)
and d2 (double) and a color (String). 
Then require the user to input an integer
k and use random quicksort to select 
the rhombuses with the kth highest areas 
(the area of a rhombus is calculated as (d1*d2)/2).
Display the list of all rhombuses 
and the selected rhombus.
