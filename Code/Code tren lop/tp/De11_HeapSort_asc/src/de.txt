Create a program that require the user to input an array of n circle. Each circle has a radius (double), 
a color (String) and the x (int) and y (int) positions of the center. 
Then use Heap sort to sort the array in ascending order of color; for circles having the same color, 
sort them in ascending order of radius. Display the list of circles at the beginning, after heapifying and after sorting.
